STREAM interactive website
--------------------------

In order to make STREAM user friendly and accessible to non-bioinformatician, we have created an interactive website: [http://stream.pinellolab.org](https://stream.pinellolab.partners.org/) 

The website implements the features of **stream command line** and in addition provides interactive and exploratory panels to visualize single-cell trajectories.  

The website offers two functions: 

1) To run STREAM on single-cell transcriptomic or epigenomic data provided by the users.  
2) The first interactive database of precomputed trajectories with results for seven published datasets. The users can visualize and explore cellsâ€™ developmental trajectories, subpopulations and their gene expression patterns at single-cell level. 

**Note: The website can also run on a local machine using the provided Docker image we have created.** 


Installation with Docker
------------------------

Docker can be downloaded freely from here: [https://store.docker.com/search?offering=community&type=edition](https://store.docker.com/search?offering=community&type=edition)

To get an image of STREAM_web, simply execute the following command:

```sh
$ docker pull pinellolab/stream_web
```

To run the website on a local machine after the Docker installation, from the command line execute the following command:
```sh
$ docker run -p 10001:10001 pinellolab/stream_web
```

After the execution of the command the user will have a local instance of the website accessible at the URL: 
[http://localhost:10001](http://localhost:10001)

To stop the website, from the command line execute the following command:
